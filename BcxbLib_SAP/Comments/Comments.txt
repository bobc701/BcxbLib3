#2101.01 -- Changes for league stats at player level. (branch b2101.01)

8/27'20
Branch dev5
This is a test change.

5/22'19
Changed members of CBatBoxSet to property get/set's i/o fields, for Xamarin binding.
Added operator+ to CBatBoxSet and CPitBoxSet to simplify getting totals.
Added property get 'IpDisplay' to CPitBOxSet for showing ip3 as X.1, X.2, etc.


#1706.27
Fixed the problem with fielding wheel not displaying labels. On BcxbLib side,
this involved changing CParamBarFielding's 'description' to a property,
Description, which assigns description and also parses it into separate labels.


#1706.20
Error handling added in CEngine.DoList and also in CGame.DoAction.
All changes in BcxbLib side, as I just reused CGame's ENotifyUser to
cause an alert to show on UI side.

#1706.19 -- 
Fixed bug in DoAction where [99] (or 1099) was getting prob for cpara.oth.
            But that's no good for stealing, or stealing home, so I changed it to 
            1.0 - cum, which will force r <= cum, which should work for both regular
            plays and stealing.

I added SerializeResults to CGame, for idea of accessing in JavaScript.

11/22'16
I have gone through and implimented CTeam throughout and got clean compile,
It has now been (minimally) tested in iOS and CSApp -- it runs!


11/17'16:
I made a new branch (b1) and impliemnted CTeam.

#1605.02:
Added new class, CTEam, and instantiated a 2-elt array in CGame.
But have not fully integrated it into game logic.

#1604.02 -- Changes to Updating box scores so it is driven by a list.

#1605.01: 
I consolidated logic to combine batter & pitcher parameters into new method,
CombineParamsets. It is in CHittingParamset as a static. It is called from InitBatter,
peplacing logic that was there previously.


#1604.02 -- Changes to Updating box scores so it is driven by a List<>.
